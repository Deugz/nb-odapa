Open Dialogues 2023 is run by students inspired by the previous Open Dialogues, with the support of the previous committee. It aims to build on the success and community of the last Open Dialogues and continue the ethos of a conference designed to support physics and astronomy students from all diciplines and backgrounds.

If you would like to know more about this year’s conference, please get in touch with the organising committee chair, Marta Podgorny, (<a href="marta.podgorny@open.ac.uk" target= "_blank">marta.podgorny@open.ac.uk </a>).
